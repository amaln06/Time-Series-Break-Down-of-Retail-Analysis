# Time-Series-Break-Down-of-Retail-Analysis
# Project Overview
This project analyzes Walmart retail sales data to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns using time series analysis. The dataset consists of 4 files provided in Kaggleâ€™s Walmart Sales Forecasting dataset.

# Dataset Files

1. Train.csv: Weekly sales data by Store & Department (main file for analysis).
2. Test.csv: Same structure as Train.csv, but without sales (for forecasting tasks).
3. Stores.csv: Store information (store type, size).
4. Features.csv: External factors (temperature, fuel price, CPI, unemployment, holidays).

# Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Seaborn)

# Steps to Perform Analysis
1. Load and Explore Data: Import Train.csv, Convert Date column into datetime format, Set Date as index for time series.
2. Aggregate Sales: Resample data from weekly, monthly sales, Create store-level and department-level sales breakdowns.
3. Visualize Trends:Line plots of monthly sales, Add moving averages (3-month or 6-month rolling mean), Compare sales across different stores and departments
4. Seasonal & Trend Decomposition: Use seasonal decomposition to separate, Trend (long-term movement), Seasonality (repeating patterns, e.g., holiday spikes), Residuals (random noise).
5. Breakdown by Region / Product: Group sales by Store or Dept over time, Compare performance of different regions/products.
6. Forecasting: Applied Rolling Mean or Exponential Smoothing for forecasting next few months, Visualize forecasted vs actual sales

# Outcome of the Project 
Sales Trend Chart (increasing/decreasing trend over time)
Moving Average Chart (smoothed trend)
Seasonal Decomposition Plot (trend + seasonality + residuals)
Store/Dept-wise Sales Comparison Charts
Forecast Plot (future predictions)
